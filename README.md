Hi!
I'd like to say a few words about this project.

1. The layout is intentionally the simplest - the emphasis was on functionality, in fact, I layout better :).
2. New user registration cannot be created - there is no such endpoint on the server. User needs to register at samuraijs.com. Or use the test data, which I will attach below. They are also listed above the login form.
3. HashRouter is used only to make the application work correctly on gh-pages, I realize that BrowserRouter is cooler :).
4. Only part of the functionality available on the provided API is done - what is not done is done similarly, which means I'd better spend my time learning new things.... :)
   
Data for testing the application:
Email: free@samuraijs.com
Password: free

If you repeatedly enter incorrect data - you will have to enter captcha.

The application can also be viewed on gh-pages at https://dmitri-tro.github.io/social-network-React-Redux-/.
